      <p class="tour-description"> See Georgia’s most spectacular canyons on a day tour from Kutaisi. The tour begins with pick-up from your hotel. The main destination town of Martvili is located to the west of
        Kutaisi City. Alongside the road, you can see charming villages with beautiful alleys and yards.
        After 1 hour of driving, you will enter the Canyon’s visitor center. Travelers are offered a boat trip through a Canyon and a pass to the amazing waterfalls. The colors of the canyon are amazing, as the light intensity changes regularly
        while passing the gorge.
      </p>

      <p class="tour-description">Canyon and Cave tour program includes a stop at the Okatse Canyons. This is a natural monument with recently built high quality tourist infrastructure, including stairs and footpaths offering magnificent views over the
        canyon and its surroundings. Kinchkha Waterfall, 30 minutes drive from Okatse, is one of the highest in the country. You will reach it by a trail arranged along the river side, offering amazing views of canyon and its surroundings. Zipline over Kinckha
        waterfalls really takes your breath ! Last stop at mystical Prometheus Cave. Your walk through mistical labirinth of underground halls under the accompaniment of classical music.
