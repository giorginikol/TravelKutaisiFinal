      <p class="tour-description">Racha is a highland area in western Georgia, located in the upper Rioni river valley and hemmed in by the Greater Caucasus mountains. Racha occupies 2,854 km2 in the north-eastern corner of western Georgia. Spurs of
        the Greater Caucasus crest separates Racha from the Georgian historical regions of Svaneti and Lechkhumi. The main Caucasus ridge forms a boundary with Russia’s North Ossetia. Racha had been part of Colchis and Caucasian Iberia since ancient
        times and its main town Oni was said to have been founded by King Parnajom of Iberia in the 2nd century BC. Upon creation of the unified Georgian
        kingdom in the 11th century, Racha became one of the duchies (saeristavo) within it.
      </p>

      <p class="tour-description"> Rati of the Baghvashi family was the first duke (eristavi) appointed by King Bagrat III. Descendants of Rati and his son Kakhaber, eponymous father of
        Racha's ruling dynasty of Kakhaberisdze, governed the province until 1278. In 1278 King David VI Narin abolished the duchy during his war against the Mongols. In the mid-14th century, the duchy was restored under the rule of the Charelidze
        family.
        Racha is a homeland of Georgia’s premium class wine, well known as “Kvanckhara”. You may find there picturesque mountains, noisy waterfalls and family wineries, producing amazing wine.

      <p class="tour-description"> Khevsureti, mountainous land of Georgia, is home to extraordinary defensive architecture, amazing views over canyons and forested valleys. Khevsurs never obey local lords; they elected their leaders, council of
        elders and serve only to monarch. They were well-known warriors, with a reputation of possessing special skills and forces, being often promoted as royal bodyguards. Kings regarded them as reliable guardians of the Caucasus Mountains and the
        northern border of the
        kingdom.
      </p>

      <p class="tour-description"> There has been a hypothesis, that these Georgian highlanders were descendants of the last European Crusaders, because their folk culture – the material, social and religious practices – greatly resembled those of
        the Crusaders. Despite
        Khevsurs are mentioned in Greek, Roman and Georgian sources before the formation of European Crusades, the pure Crusader origin of Khevsurs is not supported by most modern scholars. However, some form of settlement of Crusaders in these areas
        is possible, as they are mentioned in several manuscripts of the time as participants of several battles against the Muslims in Georgia (100 "Frankish" Crusaders participated in King David's army in the Battle of Didgori), and some could have
        passed through here after the fall of the Holy Land. More about Khevsureti

        Kakheti, eastern region, is Georgia’s premier wine-producing area. Almost three-quarters of the country's wine grapes are grown here, on land that has been used for viticulture for thousands of years. Scientists have discovered the
        world's oldest wine in Shulaveri, Georgia - a vintage produced 8,000 years ago.
        The unique Georgian way of making wine was passed on by the Orthodox monks through the ages. What makes Georgian wine unique is ‘kvevri’ – large clay
        vessels used for the fermentation and storage of wine since ancient times. Even though kvevris are buried below ground level, old masters still decorated the surface with their signature patterns. It is a sign of special reverence.
      </p>
      <p class="tour-description">
        Each village in Kakheti’s fertile valleys makes its unique wine. Kakheti was an independent feudal principality from the end of the 8th century. It was incorporated into the united Georgian Kingdom at the beginning of the 11th century, but
        for less than a decade. Only in the early 12th century did Georgian King David the Builder (1089–1125) incorporate Kakheti into his Kingdom successfully.

        Located on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, Tusheti is bordered by the Russian republics of Chechnya and Dagestan to the north and east, respectively; and by the Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav-Khevsureti
        to the south and west, respectively. The population of the area is mainly ethnic Georgians called Tushs or Tushetians (Georgian: tushebi). For centuries there have been two communities next to each other in Tusheti, one speaking the Nakh
        language, the other Old Georgian. The general name for them is tush, according to their language either Tsova- or Chagma-Tushian.
      </p>
      <p class="tour-description">
        After the collapse of the unified Georgian monarchy, Tusheti came under the rule of Kakhetian kings in the fifteenth century. Many Tush families began to move southwards from Tusheti during the first half of the nineteenth century and settled
        in the low-lying fields of Alvan at the western end of Kakheti. (Alvan had already belonged to the Tush as a wintering-ground for their flocks for centuries; it was bequeathed to them in the seventeenth century in recognition of their
        valuable assistance in defeating a Persian army at the Battle of Bakhtrioni in 1659.
      </p>
      <p class="tour-description">
        Traditionally, the Tushs are sheep herders. Tushetian Guda cheese and high quality wool was famous and was exported to Europe and Russia. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the leading branch of the economy of highland Tusheti. The local
        shepherds spend the summer months in the highland areas of Tusheti but live in the lowland villages of Zemo Alvani and Kvemo Alvani in wintertime. Their customs and traditions are similar to those of other eastern Georgian mountaineers (see
        Khevsureti). One of the most ecologically unspoiled regions in the Caucasus, Tusheti is a popular mountain trekking venue. Pork is considered taboo in Tusheti. Farmers will not raise pigs and travelers are usually advised to not bring any
        pork into the region. Locals will however eat pork themselves when not in Tusheti. More about Tusheti

        Tbilisi commonly known by its former name Tiflis, is the capital and the largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks of the Mtkvari River with a population of roughly 1.5 million inhabitants. Founded in the 5th century by the monarch of
        Georgia's ancient precursor the Kingdom of Iberia, Tbilisi has since served, as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Under Russian rule, from 1801 to 1917 Tiflis was the seat of the Imperial Viceroy governing both sides of
        the entire Caucasus. </p>

      <p class="tour-description">
        Located on the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Tbilisi's proximity to lucrative east-west trade routes often made the city a point of contention between various rival empires throughout history and the city's location to this day ensures its
        position as an important transit route for global energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's varied history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, classical, Middle Eastern, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and Modernist structures.
      </p>
      <p class="tour-description">
        Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though it is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Notable tourist destinations include cathedrals like Sameba and Sioni, classical
        Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum.
